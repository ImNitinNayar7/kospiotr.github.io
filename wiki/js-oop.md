# Principles

* **Encapsulation** -  Data can be grouped together with functionality that operates on that data. This, quite simply, is the definition of an object.
* **Aggregation** -  One object can reference another object.
* **Inheritance** -  A newly created object has the same characteristics as another object without explicitly duplicating its functionality.
* **Polymorphism** - One interface may be implemented by multiple objects.
