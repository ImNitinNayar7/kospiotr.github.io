#Netbeans

##Pros
* Free
* Very nice key shortcuts by default inspired by browsers and total commander
* Great refactoring tools for single class as well for batch processing
* Great formatting options
* Very good Java Debugger
* Very nice templating engine

##Const
* Very slow on weak computers like VDIs, with many big projects
* Looks like shit on Linux, looks ugly on Windows, looks great on Mac, dark theme is UX fatal misunderstanding
* Weak plugins quality
* No JavaScript Debugger for Node applications

#Intellij

##Pros
* Very fast on weak machines with many projects openned at once
* Very fast finding class / file
* Very nice look Light + Darcula
* Very nice settings windows
* Custom wrapper on Maven executes faster some goals / tests / code coverages

##Const
* Commercial, very expensive
* Very non intuitive shortcuts by deault
* Continous saving file
* Failing Subversion plugin
