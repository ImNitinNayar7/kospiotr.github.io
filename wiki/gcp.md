# Big Data

Hadoop base terminology:
* HDFS - Hadoop distributed file system - stores data which needs to be processed and the data which are the result of the processing
* MapReduce - framework which defines a data processing task 
* YARN - yet another resource - framework which runs data processing tasks

Hadoop ecosystem technologies:
* HIVE - provides SQL interface to Hadoop - OLAP sources, in GCP it's BigQuery
* HBase - columnar (NoSQL) data base management system on top of Hadoop, in GCP it's BigTable
* Pig - data manipulation language which allows reading unstructured data and writing as structured, for example reading logs and witing them to HDFS, it's GCP DataFlow
* Spark - distributed compute engine used along with Hadoop, it's GCP DataFlow
* Oozie - A tool to schedule workflows on all Hadoop ecosystem technologies in other words it makes Hadoop being managed as Dataproc is doing on GCP
* Kafka - stream data process in the realtime, equivalent in GCP is Pub / Sub

Flow:

Map Reduce -> YARN -> HDFS

## BigQuery

## Cloud Load Balancing
Multi-region Load Distribution

Network Load Balancing (NLB) L4
* Region / Cross-Region - NLB supports only within a region. Does not support cross-region load balancing.
* Load balancing based on - NLB is based on IP address, port and protocol type. Any TCP/UDP traffic, even SMTP can be load balanced.
* Packet inspection - Packet inspection is possible and load balance based on packets
* Instance Group - No need of creating instance group. Target pools need to be created. Instance can be just tagged to the pool. Ideal for unmanaged instance group where instances are non homogeneous.     
* Workflow - Forwarding rules is the starting point. It directs the request to the target pools from which compute engines will pick the request. Forwarding rules -> target pool -> instances                           
* Types of load balancer - Basic network load balancer which directs the request based on IP address, port and the protocol within the region. 
* Session affinity - Session affinity can be set, but only during the creation of target pool. Once it is set, the value cannot be changed.                    
* Health check - Health check is optional, but network load balancing relies on HTTP Health checks for determining instance health. 

Commands:
* `gcloud compute forwarding-rules list`
* `gcloud compute forwarding-rules create pkosmowski-nginx-lb 
         --region europe-west1 
         --ports=80 
         --target-pool pkosmowski-nginx-pool` - create forwarding rule (LB Frontend) which allows accessing LB from outside


HTTP(S) Load Balancing (HLB) L7
* Region / Cross-Region - HLB supports both within cross-region load balancing.
* Load balancing based on - HLB is based only on HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
* Packet inspection - HLB cannot inspect packets.
* Instance Group - Managed / UnManaged Instance group is necessary for creating HTTP / HTTPS load balancer.
* Workflow - This is quite complex in HTTP(s) load balancer. Global forwarding rulesroutes direct the request     
to target HTTP proxy, which in turn checks the URL map to determine appropriate backend services. These services in turn direct the request to the instance group. Global forwarding rules -> Target HTTP proxy -> URL map -> Backend Sevices -> instance group
* Types of load balancer - 
1. Cross-region load balancer uses only one global IP address and routes the request to the nearest region. 
2. Content-based load balancer is based on the URL path. Different path rules need different backend services. for eg: /video and /static require two separate backend services. 
* Session affinity - 
1. Client IP Affinity: This directs the same client ip to same backend instance by              
computing hash of the IP.
2. Generated Cookie Affinity: Load balancer stores cookie in clients and directs the same client to same instance with the help of retrieved cookie.
* Health check - Health can be verified by either using HTTP heath check or HTTPS health check.          

Commands:
* `gcloud compute http-health-checks create pkosmowski-http-basic-check` - create healthcheck
* `gcloud compute instance-groups managed 
       set-named-ports pkosmowski-nginx-group 
       --named-ports http:80` - add named port to the instance group which 
* `gcloud compute backend-services add-backend pkosmowski-nginx-backend 
    --instance-group pkosmowski-nginx-group 
    --instance-group-zone europe-west1-c 
    --global` - Add the instance group into the backend service
* `gcloud compute url-maps create pkosmowski-web-map 
    --default-service pkosmowski-nginx-backend` - Create a default URL map that directs all incoming requests to the given instances
* `gcloud compute target-http-proxies create pkosmowski-http-lb-proxy 
    --url-map pkosmowski-web-map` - Create a target HTTP proxy to route requests to the URL map
* `gcloud compute forwarding-rules create pkosmowski-http-content-rule 
        --global 
        --target-http-proxy pkosmowski-http-lb-proxy 
        --ports 80` - create forwarding rule (LB Frontend) which allows accessing LB from outside

Docs: [https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview)

**Who** can do **what** on which **resource**

* Who:  Google account, Service account, Google group, G Suite domain, Cloud Identity domain
* What: 
  * Roles - sets of permissions; types: Primitive roles, Predefined roles (permissions to the specific service), Custom roles
  * Permissions
* Resource: Cloud Platform resources are organized hierarchically, where the Organization node is the root node in the hierarchy, the projects are the children of the Organization, and the other resources are the children of projects. Each resource has exactly one parent.

Other features:
* Automatic (SSH) key management
* Manual key management (SSH key in project or resource metadata section )
* sudo

Best practices:
* Reuse your existing Identities - import to G-Suite users and groups from existing on-premises via Google Cloud Directory Sync 
* Don't store keys in code - create service account and if app is using other Google services via SDK libraries then:
  * app installed on GCP is already authorized and don't need to use keys at all
  * for local development app create environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` with path to the key
* Use 2 step verification
* Disable SSH password authentication
* Disable root login and use sudo instead
* Grant least privilege - reduce the number of accounts that perform powerfull operations
* Grant Roles to Groups, not Users
* Grant least privileges to applications - create service account per application component
* Rotate keys - service account keys, ssh keys
* No secrets in instance metadata - everybody who can read instance metadata can see secrets, instead save them in the Cloud Storage and give service account permission to read it
* Leave a trace - retain audit logs in Cloud Storage or Big Query, forward guest events to centralized logging
